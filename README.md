# Hi, I’m @lachm99
My friends call me Lachie.
*Welcome to my GitHub!*

I'm a final year student from The University of Sydney, Australia, studying a BSci in Computer Science and Software Development - But I have a keen interest in all things technology and computation, so I've dipped my toes into lots of different fields.

This GitHub mostly stores a number of disparate projects that I've worked on, mostly for Uni.
I've produced a breadth of work, including:
- Algorithm design and implementation
- Computational data science and statistical analysis/reporting
- Software and game development
- Hobbyist web development

I love problem solving and coming up with creative software solutions - and with each develop these skills just a bit more.
At this point, I've had experience using:
- Python
- Java
- C
- R
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (although I'm very aware of how limited my exposure has been!)
- Cloud Computing Services
