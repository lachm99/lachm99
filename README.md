# Hi, I’m Lachie
_*Welcome to my GitHub!*_

I'm a Computer Scientist and Software Developer with a BSci from the University of Sydney - but I have a keen interest in all things technology and computation, so I've dipped my toes into lots of different fields.

This GitHub stores a number of disparate personal projects that I've worked on, mostly from my time at uni.
I've produced a breadth of work, covering:
- Algorithm design and implementation
- Computational data science and statistical analysis/reporting
- Machine Learning and Prediction Models
- Software and game development
- Hobbyist web development

I love problem solving and coming up with creative software solutions - and with each project I develop these skills just a bit more. 

At this point, my experience includes:  
- Python
- Java
- C
- R
- Kubernetes
- Cloud Computing Services
- Unix & Bash
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (In small doses!)
